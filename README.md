# Stemscape

A plant based music generator created in JavaScript.

I have had this idea for a long time, and after spending the summer learning JavaScript, I naturally drifted to the p5.js library.  It basically let's you write Processing code in JavaScript.

So, I use that to explore my love of fractals through L-Systems, which is pretty much a kind of math that describes how plants grow.

I also heard about a library called Tone.js.  I don't know much about it, but we are going to use it to make music, in the browser, with plants!
