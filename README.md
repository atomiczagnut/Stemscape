# 🌱 Stemscape

**Stemscape is an expression of music as plants experience it, through L-Systems.**

An artistic endeavor that challenges you to cultivate a plant as if it were an artistic object. Experience the intersection of botany, mathematics, and sound in an interactive web environment where every interaction generates music.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌿 Real-time Plant Cultivation**: Grow and prune plants dynamically with mouse interactions
- **🎵 Generative Audio**: Every user action generates unique sounds based on plant structure
- **📐 L-System Mathematics**: Explore fractal botany through algorithmic plant growth
- **🎨 Interactive Art**: Cultivate living musical sculptures that respond to your touch

## 🎯 For Musicians, Artists, Students & Botanists

Whether you're exploring generative music, studying fractal mathematics, or simply enjoying interactive art, Stemscape offers a unique lens into how plants might experience the world through sound.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- A modern web browser with Web Audio API support

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/atomiczagnut/Stemscape.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Stemscape/Stemscape

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and start cultivating!

## 🎮 How to Use

- **Left Click**: Select branches and hear their unique musical properties
- **Right Click**: Prune branches (coming soon)
- **Drag**: Manipulate branch angles and watch the plant respond
- **Listen**: Each interaction generates sounds based on branch angle, generation, and position

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **p5.js**: Creative coding framework for visual rendering
- **Tone.js**: Web Audio API framework for sound synthesis

### L-Systems Explained
Plants grow in mathematical ways. By conforming to certain rules, plants branch out just as nature intended. Simple algorithmic rules lead to complicated, fractal forms that mirror the complexity found in real botanical structures.

## 🛣️ Future Plans

- **Enhanced L-System Algorithms**: More diverse plant species and growth patterns
- **Advanced Musicality**: Deeper integration between plant structure and musical composition
- **Community Contributions**: As an open-source project under GNU GPL 3.0, we welcome contributions from developers, artists, and botanists

## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration

- **Electroplankton**: The Nintendo DS game that sparked the original inspiration for interactive musical environments
- **Cory Boehne**: For guidance with JSON patterns and development insights
- **Jon Stach**: For inspiration and coding mentorship
