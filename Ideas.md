##Game Intro

I really like the animation loop where you watch the plants grow.  The game should start like that.  There a couple of random "seeds", and maybe 3 iterations of growth, before the player takes control.

##Controls

The player can click and drag on branches and change their angle.  The player can double-click to make them grow.

Maybe we can come up with better controls?

##Playhead object

There will be some object that bounces around between the branches.  It plays a tone when it strikes each branch, and responds with particle physics.  

However, unlike real physics, when this hits the ground, it loops right back to falling out of the sky.

I haven't decided what the object should be yet, but it should be something silly
